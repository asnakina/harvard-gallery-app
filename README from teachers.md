# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, our Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you can be proud of.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to show your project to your instructors and classmates in a five minute presentation in front of the class. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking about your code.

Show us what you've got!

## Requirements

#### Your website must:

- Be a working, interactive, React application.
- Include **one** of the following:
    - Pull data into the application using an API  
        [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)  
        [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)  
    -TRY OUT your API in insomnia before you get too emotionally invested in it, to make sure it works the way you think it  does...
    - Have two distinct "views" in your application using conditional rendering
- Have at least 4 separate components, each with their own folder in your application.
- Be built using Create React App
- Be styled with CSS.
- Use flexbox layout...or learn something new like CSS Grid.
- Use functional components and class components appropriately  
- Be deployed via GitHub and Surge  

#### Your code must:

- Be properly indented
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names
- Be written with kebab-case (dashes) CSS class names
- No `console.log()` or commented out code in final version
- Only React for DOM manipulation

#### Your README must include:

- Name of your project
- Brief description of the project
- A link to your deployed project
- Images of your wireframe 

## Necessary Deliverables

#### For the proposal:
- A collection of wireframes - hand-drawn or digitally created - outlining the important pages of your site, as well as the critical states of your project, drawing a component hierarchy would be a great way to indicate which components need state and which components need props.
- A proposal including:
	- A description of the project you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language.
	- An explanation of the major problems you plan to face while implementing this app.
	- An explanation of how you foresee yourself solving the aforementioned problems.
- If using an API, a link to the API you plan to use

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)
