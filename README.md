#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, our Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you can be proud of.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to show your project to your instructors and classmates in a five minute presentation in front of the class. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking about your code.

Show us what you've got!

## Due Dates

Your proposal for this project, as outlined in the proposal section below, must be completed and ready to present for approval by:

- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names
- Be written with kebab-case CSS class names
- No console.log() or commented out code in final version

#### Your README must:

- Name of your project
- Brief description of the project
- A link to your deployed project

**Bonus**

- Include a "Tutorial Section" of this landing page (why: instructions help think through the "UX" of your project)

## Necessary Deliverables

#### For the proposal:
- A collection of wireframes - hand-drawn or digitally created - outlining the important pages of your site, as well as the critical states of your project.
- A proposal including:
	- A description of the project you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language.
	- An explanation of the major problems you plan to face while implementing this app.
	- An explanation of how you foresee yourself solving the aforementioned problems.
  - If using an API, a link to the API you plan to use

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)
